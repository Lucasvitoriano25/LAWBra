## Abstract
This work focuses on enhancing the effectiveness of the Brazilian legal system through the application of Natural Language Processing technologies. Utilizing the Iudicium Textum Dataset, we fine-tune small LLM models such as Google Gemma and Microsoft PHI-2, aiming to create a sophisticated tool capable of understanding and analyzing legal documents within the Brazilian context.

## Introduction
The evolution of NLP technologies presents new opportunities for the legal field, especially in streamlining case analysis and judicial decision-making processes. Our project harnesses these advancements to serve the specific needs of the Brazilian legal system, contributing to the broader field of NLP.

## Background
### Dataset
Our primary dataset comprises legal decisions from the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, designed to address the shortage of Portuguese language resources for NLP model training.


### Models Employed
We utilize Google Gemma and Microsoft Phi-2 models, chosen for their balance between performance and computational feasibility.

## Experiments / Results
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning in improving model performance for legal text analysis, compared against baselines like GPT 3.5 Turbo.
